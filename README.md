# Youtube data harvesting and warehousing using SQL and streamlit
I have done this project with the skills Python scripting, Data collection, Streamlit, API integration and Data management using SQL.

This project is to create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple channels from YOUTUBE.

The process I have done in this project are 
1. setting up a streamlit app,
2. getting a connect to the Youtube API,
3. storing and cleaning the data that I have fetched,
4. migrating those datas to a SQL data warehouse using MYSQL.
5. querying the SQL data warehouse
6. Finally, displaying the data in the streamlit app.
